# SPLIT MASTER INSTALL

#--------------------------------------------------------------------
# Global Answers
# These answers are always needed.

# Y or N — Whether to install. Answer files must set this to Y.
q_install=y

# Y or N — Whether the installer has permission to install additional packages
# from the OS’s repositories. If this is set to N, the installation will fail
# if the installer detects missing dependencies.
q_vendor_packages_install=y

#--------------------------------------------------------------------
# Components
# These answers are always needed.

# Y or N — Whether to install the puppet master role.
q_puppetmaster_install=y

# Y or N — Whether to install the database support (the console Postgres server
# and PuppetDB) role.
q_puppetdb_install=n

#--------------------------------------------------------------------
# Puppet Agent Answers
# These answers are always needed.

# Y or N — This is a silent install option, default is N. When set to "Y", the
# installer will skip master verification which allows the user to deploy agents
# when they know the master won’t be available.
q_skip_master_verification=n

#--------------------------------------------------------------------
# Puppet Master Answers
# These answers are generally needed if you are installing the puppet master
# role.

# Y or N — Whether or not the installation is an all-in-one installation,
# (i.e., are puppetdb and the console also being installed on this node).
q_all_in_one_install=n

# String — An identifying string for the puppet master. This ID must be unique
# across your entire site. The server’s fully qualified domain name is often
# used as the puppet master’s certname.
q_puppetmaster_certname=pe-master.localdomain

# String — Valid DNS names at which the puppet master can be reached. Must be a
# comma-separated list. In a normal installation, defaults to
# <hostname>,<hostname.domain>,puppet,puppet.<domain>.
q_puppetmaster_dnsaltnames=pe-master,pe-master.localdomain

# String — The hostname of the server running the console role. Only needed if
# you are not installing the console role on the puppet master server.
q_puppetmaster_enterpriseconsole_hostname=pe-console.localdomain

# Integer — The port on which to contact the console server. Only needed if you
# are not installing the console role on the puppet master server.
q_puppetmaster_enterpriseconsole_port=443

# y or n; MUST BE LOWERCASE — Whether to check for updates whenever the pe-httpd
# service restarts. To get the correct update info, the server will pass some
# basic, anonymous info to Puppet Labs’ servers. Specifically, it will transmit:
# the IP address of the client
# the type and version of the client’s OS
# the installed version of PE
# the number of nodes licensed and the number of nodes used
# If you wish to disable update checks (e.g. if your company policy forbids
# transmitting this information), you will need to set this to n. You can also
# disable checking after installation by editing the
# /etc/puppetlabs/installer/answers.install file.
q_pe_check_for_updates=y

# String — A publicly accessible hostname where the console can be accessed if
# the host name resolves to a private interface (e.g., Amazon EC2). This is set
# automatically by the installer on EC2 nodes, but can be set manually in
# environments with multiple hostnames.
#q_public_hostname=

# String — The git url to be passed to the r10k.yaml file
# This can be any URL that is supported by r10k ( and normally git )
# This answer is OPTIONAL and only needed if you would like r10k configured
# at time of the Puppet Enterprise installation on the master
#q_puppetmaster_r10k_remote='git@your.git.server.com:puppet/control.git'

# String — The local filesystem path on the master where the ssh private key
# can be found and used by r10k. This answer is OPTIONAL and only needed if
# would like r10k configured at time of the Puppet Enterprise installation.
# This must be specified in conjunction with q_puppetmaster_r10k_remote
# to be populated in the configuration file. This will enable rugged
# support in r10k allowing you to use on systems without git installed.
#q_puppetmaster_r10k_private_key=/root/.ssh/id_dsa

# Y or N - Whether or not the file sync service should be enabled on the master
# node.  This will be 'Y' by default for installs and 'N' by default for
# upgrades because migrating an existing codedir to codedir-staging is a manual
# process.  It should only be overridden if you have already made that migration.
#
# NOTE: For split installs, if you set this on your master, you must have the
# same answer on the console node for correct classification or the changes
# will be overriden during the first puppet run on the master.
#q_puppetmaster_file_sync_service_enabled=

# Y or N - Whether to automatically configure code-manager. This answer is
# OPTIONAL and only needed if you would like code-manager to be configured at
# install time based on r10k answers.
#q_puppetmaster_code_manager_auto_configure=n

# String - The database orchestrator will use.
q_orchestrator_database_name=pe-orchestrator

# String - The password for Orchestrator's root user.
q_orchestrator_database_password=strongpassword9285

# String - Orchestator’s root user name
q_orchestrator_database_user=pe-orchestrator

#--------------------------------------------------------------------
# PuppetDB Answers

# String — The hostname of the server running PuppetDB.
q_puppetdb_hostname=pe-puppetdb.localdomain

# Integer — The port where the PuppetDB server can be reached.
q_puppetdb_port=8081

# Whether to exit the installer (during upgrade) to perform the NC Data Migration process
# See http://docs.puppetlabs.com/pe/3.8/install_upgrade_migration_tool.html

q_exit_for_nc_migrate=n
